{"name":"Slidesetlightbox Widget","tagline":"Advanced version of Yootheme's Slideset Widget (Widgetkit2) with lightbox support","body":"![Slidesetlightbox widget logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvalitov/widgetkit-slidesetlightbox/master/images/logo.png)\r\n# Overview\r\n**Slidesetlightbox** is an advanced [Slideset widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/slideset) for [Yootheme Widgetkit2](https://yootheme.com/widgetkit). After installation it becomes available in the Widgets list as a \"native\" widget and can be used with any [Warp 7 theme](https://yootheme.com/themes).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nOr why it's better than original Slideset provided by Yootheme?\r\n* **Lightbox support** - you may choose how the widget will respond to user clicks: standard behavior or [lightbox mode](http://getuikit.com/docs/lightbox.html).\r\n* **Backward compatibility** - all other behavior, styling and features of the original [Slideset widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/slideset) are preserved.\r\n\r\n# Supported platforms\r\n* The code is based on Widgetkit 2.5.0, however it should work with any Widgetkit 2.4.x and later.\r\n* Joomla 3.4.x or later required\r\nI didn't test it with Wordpress.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n## Installation Overview\r\nWe use \"clean\" and \"neat\" approach according to the official Yootheme's manual:\r\n* [Custom widgetkit plugin](http://yootheme.com/widgetkit/documentation/customizing/custom-widget-plugin)\r\n* [Where to store your customizations](https://yootheme.com/widgetkit/documentation/customizing/where-to-store-your-customizations)\r\n\r\nSuch approach allows you to:\r\n* keep original Yootheme's Widgetkit source files\r\n* preserve original Yootheme's functionality\r\n* safely do updates to Yootheme's files (download new versions of Widgetkit 2), keeping our new widget (modifications won't be overwritten during update process)\r\n\r\n## Installation Process\r\nThe installation is very simple. You just need to copy the folder _slidesetlightbox_ to _/templates/THEME-NAME/widgetkit/widgets/_, so that you will have a folder _/templates/THEME-NAME/widgetkit/widgets/slidesetlightbox_. The _THEME-NAME_ is a folder of your [Warp 7 theme](https://yootheme.com/themes), e.g. it can be _yoo_vida_, _yoo_finch_, etc. \r\n\r\n# Setup and usage\r\n## Configure the widget\r\nAfter successful installation you should see the _Slideset Lightbox_ widget in the widgetkit control panel page, so that you can select it from the list:\r\n![Slidesetlightbox widget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvalitov/widgetkit-slidesetlightbox/master/images/widgetkit-list.jpeg)\r\n\r\nYou should configure the widget as usual, e.g. the [Yootheme documentation](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/slideset) can be useful.\r\n\r\nAll the advanced features of the Slidesetlightbox are located in a dedicated section called _Advanced Features_:\r\n![Slidesetlightbox widget settings screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvalitov/widgetkit-slidesetlightbox/master/images/settings.jpeg)\r\nIf you don't activate any of these features, then the Slidesetlightbox behaves exactly as the original Slideset widget from the Widgetkit bundle.\r\n\r\nOptions and description:\r\n* **Lightbox Type** - defines the behavior how widget responds to user clicks, possible values:\r\n    + **none** - standard behavior, the widget works the same way as the original Slideset widget does.\r\n    + **Lightbox** - lightbox opens with \"full size\" image, user can switch between the images using array buttons (image grouping is implemented) in the lightbox mode without closing it.\r\n\r\n# Extra\r\nA tutorial how the first version of this module was created is available on the [Yootheme forum](https://yootheme.com/support/question/85422).\r\n\r\n# Authors, Contributors and Acknowledgment\r\n* This widget is created by [Ramil Valitov](http://www.valitov.me).\r\n* The code is based on the original [Slideset widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/map) by [Yootheme](http://yootheme.com/).\r\n\r\n# Feedback\r\nYour feedback is very appreciated.
