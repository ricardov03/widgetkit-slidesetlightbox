# Overview
**Slidesetlightbox** is an advanced version of [Slideset widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/slideset) for [Yootheme Widgetkit2](https://yootheme.com/widgetkit). After installation it becomes available in the Widgets list as a "native" widget and can be used as any other widget.

## Features
### Basic Features
* **Present groups of images in sets** that you can loop through.
* **Navigation controls and filters** - can apply different navigations and transitions, filter items by tag and display content items in an overlay.
* **Backward compatibility** - all other behavior, styling and features of the original [Slideset widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/slideset) are preserved.
### Unique Features
The new features that the Slidesetlightbox has and that are not available in the original Slideset widget:

* **Lightbox support** - you may choose how the widget will respond to user clicks: standard behavior or lightbox mode, [read more](https://github.com/rvalitov/widgetkit-slidesetlightbox/wiki/Lightbox-mode).
* **Tooltips for all options** - it's much easier to use the widget, because tooltips are available for all settings.

# Supported platforms
* The code is based on Widgetkit 2.5.0 (identical to 2.5.3), however it should work with any Widgetkit 2.4.x and later.
* Joomla 3.4.x or later required
I didn't test it with Wordpress.
